# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Firebase services

Firebase is initialized in `lib/firebase.js`.

Use ready-made service instances from `lib/firebase-services.js`:

```js
import { auth, db, storage } from '@/lib/firebase-services';
```

## Firebase auth setup

DoggyDex uses Firebase Authentication for:

- Google sign-in
- Email/password sign-in

Set these env values in `.env`:

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`

For Google sign-in on Expo/native flows, also set:

- `EXPO_CLIENT_ID`
- `IOS_CLIENT_ID`
- `ANDROID_CLIENT_ID`
- `WEB_CLIENT_ID`

Quiz progress sync is tracked in Firestore by Firebase Auth `uid`.
